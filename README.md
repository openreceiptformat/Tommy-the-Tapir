![Ecosystem](Public/ecosys.png)

Reference App for merchant side of the OFR ecosystem

**Tommy the Tapir** is an open-source framework for in-store digital interaction and receipt retrieval. It can operate independently of payment systems, but provides optional adapters for merchants who wish to integrate payments. Tommy generates receipts that conform to the **Open Receipt Format (ORF)**, while remaining intentionally agnostic to payment and settlement mechanisms by design.

# Features

- Digital menu browsing, 
- Item selection, and 
- **claim-based receipt retrieval** 

In both physical and online commerce — without replacing existing POS, checkout, or payment systems.

---

## What Tommy Is

- A lightweight interaction layer for physical and online retail
- A reference implementation for **claim-based digital receipts**
- A bridge between existing POS / e-commerce systems and ORF
- Designed to work with:
  - Cash payments
  - External POS systems
  - Third-party payment providers
  - Online platforms (e.g. Shopify, WooCommerce)

---

## What Tommy Is Not

- A payment processor
- A POS replacement
- A checkout system
- A loyalty or identity platform
- A fiscal or tax compliance engine

Tommy complements existing systems; it does not compete with them.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Claim-Based Receipts

Receipts are not pushed via email or SMS.  
They are **claimed by the customer** via an explicit action such as:

- Tapping an NFC tag
- Scanning a QR code
- Clicking a receipt link

This model improves privacy, portability, and long-term access.

---

### 2. ORF-Conformant Receipts

All receipts generated by Tommy conform to the **Open Receipt Format (ORF)** specification.

ORF defines:
- The receipt data model
- Line items, taxes, totals
- Optional payment references
- Receipt lifecycle states

ORF does **not** define payments, settlement, or authorization.

---

### 3. Payment-Optional Architecture

Tommy operates independently of payments.

Payment integration is:
- Optional
- Modular
- Adapter-based

When payment data exists, it is recorded **descriptively** in the receipt.
When it does not, the receipt remains valid.

---

## Governance Implications (Important)

Because Tommy is open source:

**Core maintainers control:**
- Receipt logic
- ORF conformance

**Community can build:**
- Payment adapters
- POS connectors
- Loyalty plugins

---

## Supported Environments

### Physical Stores
- NFC or QR entry points
- In-store menu or catalog
- Cashier-confirmed selections
- POS-independent receipt claiming

### Online Commerce
- Post-checkout receipt links
- Webhook-driven receipt generation
- Platform-agnostic receipt retrieval

---

## High-Level Architecture

![Recipta Tommy Interaction](Public/Recipta-Tommy-interaction.png)

Payments, POS systems, and checkout flows operate alongside this process, not within it.

---

## Relationship to Open Receipt Format (ORF)

Tommy is an **implementation**, not the standard.

- ORF defines *what* a receipt is
- Tommy defines *how* a receipt can be claimed

Other ORF-compatible implementations are encouraged.

---

## Project Status

Tommy the Tapir is in **early exploration and design**.

Current focus:
- Architecture documentation
- Reference flows (physical and online)
- ORF conformance patterns

Code will be added incrementally as interfaces stabilize.

---

## Contributing

Discussion, feedback, and design contributions are welcome.

If you are:
- A POS vendor
- A retailer
- A payment provider
- A standards contributor

…your perspective is especially valuable.
